This subdirectory contains files related to learning and generation:

motiondemo.m        Main file for kearning and generation
gaussiancrbm.m      Trains CRBM with Gaussian visible units
binarycrbm.m        Trains CRBM with binary logistic visible units
paramcount.m        Counts the current CRBM parameters
weightreport.m      Visualizes parameters while learning
getfilteringdist.m  After learning the first CRBM,
                    builds minibatches for the next CRBM
gen.m               Generates data from a CRBM with one hidden layer
gen2.m              Generates data from a CRBM with two hidden layers

The Motion subdirectory contains files related to motion capture data: 
preprocessing/postprocessing, playback, etc ...
