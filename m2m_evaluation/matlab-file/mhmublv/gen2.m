% This program uses the 2-level CRBM to generate data
% More efficient version than the original
%
% The program assumes that the following variables are set externally:
% numframes    -- number of frames to generate
% fr           -- a starting frame from initdata (for initialization)

%frame? we need n1 + n2 frames of data

%use this data to get the posteriors at layer 1
