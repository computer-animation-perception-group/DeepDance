% This is a function for converting from Euler CMU data to exponential maps
% It assumes that Neil Lawrence's MOCAP toolbox has been used to create a 
% skeleton structure "skel" and matrix of channels "eulerchannels".
% This function goes hierarchically through the skeleton and converts all 
% Euler angles to the exponential map representation
%
% Usage: [skel, expmapchannels] = euler2expmap(skel,eulerchannels)

%Process root
%don't touch the global translation
expmapchannels(skel.tree(1).posInd) = eulerchannels(skel.tree(1).posInd);

%keep a counter to keep track of exponential map dimensions that we are
%writing
counter = length(expmapchannels)+1;

rotVal = zeros(1, 3); %skel.tree(1).orientation;
for ii = 1:length(skel.tree(1).rotInd)
    rind = skel.tree(1).rotInd(ii);
    if rind
        rotVal(ii) = rotVal(ii) + eulerchannels(rind);
    end
end

R = rotationMatrix(deg2rad(rotVal(1)), ...
    deg2rad(rotVal(2)), ...
    deg2rad(rotVal(3)), ...
    skel.tree(1).axisOrder);

%write out the exponential map dimensions
expmapchannels(counter:counter+2) = r;
skel.tree(1).expmapInd = counter:counter+2;
counter = counter+3;

%Now go through children and convert their rotations to exponential maps
for i = 1:length(skel.tree(1).children)
    ind = skel.tree(1).children(i);
    [expmapchannels, skel, counter] = convertChild(skel, expmapchannels, ind, eulerchannels, counter);
