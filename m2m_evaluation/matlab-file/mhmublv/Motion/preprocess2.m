% We support two types of skeletons:

%     http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/
%  2) Those built from data from Eugene Hsu (mit)
%     http://people.csail.mit.edu/ehsu/work/sig05stf/
% This program preprocesses data (stage 2 of 2)
% We extract the dimensions of interest and form "mini-batches"
% We also scale the data.
% Certain joint angles are 1-2 DOF, so don't model constant zero cols
