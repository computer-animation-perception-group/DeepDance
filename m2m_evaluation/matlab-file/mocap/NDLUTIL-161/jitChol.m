function [UC, jitter] = jitChol(A, maxTries)

% JITCHOL Do a Cholesky decomposition with jitter.
%
%	Description:
%
%	U = JITCHOL(A, MAXTRIES) attempts a Cholesky decomposition on the
%	given matrix, if matrix isn't positive definite the function gives a
%	warning, adds 'jitter' and tries again. At the first attempt the
%	amount of jitter added is 1e-6 times the mean of the diagonal.
%	Thereafter the amount of jitter is multiplied by 10 each time it is
%	added again. This is continued for a maximum of 10 times.
%	 Returns:
%	  U - the Cholesky decomposition for the matrix.
%	 Arguments:
%	  A - the matrix for which the Cholesky decomposition is required.
%	  MAXTRIES - the maximum number of times that jitter is added before
%	   giving up (default 10).
%
%	[U, JITTER] = JITCHOL(A, MAXTRIES) attempts a Cholesky decomposition
%	on the given matrix, if matrix isn't positive definite the function
%	adds 'jitter' and tries again. Thereafter the amount of jitter is
%	multiplied by 10 each time it is added again. This is continued for
%	a maximum of 10 times.  The amount of jitter added is returned.
%	 Returns:
%	  U - the Cholesky decomposition for the matrix.
%	  JITTER - the amount of jitter that was added to the matrix.
%	 Arguments:
%	  A - the matrix for which the Cholesky decomposition is required.
%	  MAXTRIES - the maximum number of times that jitter is added before
%	   giving up (default 10).
